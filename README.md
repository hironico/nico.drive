## Developper information
* In order to setup the project we used a slightly updated version of the tutorial available here at [okta](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript)
* tslint being outdated, we used eslint instead with instructions here [Getting started with eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)
* In order to get HTTPS working we followed the follwing tutorial: [Running ExpressJS server over HTTPS](https://timonweb.com/javascript/running-expressjs-server-over-https/)
* After that we need configuration options: [so we use the dotEnv project](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript#a-better-way-to-manage-configuration-settings-in-nodejs)
